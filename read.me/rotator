DESIGN REPORT  

PROBLEM STATEMENT  
To design and implement an 8-bit Rotator circuit in VLSI. The rotator shifts the bits of the input word circularly to the left or right by a specified number of positions, ensuring that the rotated-out bits are reintroduced at the opposite end.  

USE CASE  
- Used in cryptographic systems for key/data mixing.  
- Useful in arithmetic operations such as multiplication/division by powers of 2.  
- Applied in signal processing algorithms where cyclic shifts are required.  
- Helps in microprocessor architectures for bit manipulation instructions.  

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
1. Input: 8-bit binary word (B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0).  
2. Control input: Direction (0 = left rotate, 1 = right rotate).  
3. Output: 8-bit binary word with bits rotated left or right by one position.  
   - Left Rotate Example: 10110010 → 01100101.  
   - Right Rotate Example: 10110010 → 01011001.  
4. Circuit should be compact and efficient.  
5. Must operate with minimum propagation delay.  

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS  
- Limited logic cells and interconnections in layout.  
- Power and area must remain minimal.  
- Circuit must pass DRC and LVS verification.  
- Reliable operation across all 8-bit input combinations.  

DESIGN METHODOLOGY & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  
1. Core Logic  
   - Multiplexers or wiring logic used to reroute bits.  
   - For left rotate: (B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0 B7).  
   - For right rotate: (B0 B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1).  

2. Implementation Steps  
   - Designed schematic using 2x1 multiplexers controlled by direction signal.  
   - Simulated functional correctness with multiple test inputs.  
   - Layout designed with CMOS logic gates and interconnections.  
   - Verified functionality via post-layout simulation.  

FUNCTIONAL SIMULATION METHODOLOGY & TEST CASES  
- Input stimulus: Different 8-bit binary values tested in both directions.  
- Test Cases:  
  - TC1: Input = 10110010 → Left = 01100101, Right = 01011001.  
  - TC2: Input = 11111111 → Left = 11111111, Right = 11111111.  
  - TC3: Input = 00010000 → Left = 00100000, Right = 00001000.  
- Simulation Tool: SPICE/Cadence for verification.  

RESULTS & ANALYSIS  
- Left and right rotations worked correctly for all test cases.  
- Minimal propagation delay since design used simple multiplexers.  
- Layout area and power consumption were very low.  
- Post-layout verification matched schematic simulation.  

CHALLENGES & CONCLUSIONS  
Challenges:  
- Avoiding errors in bit position mapping for both left and right rotations.  
- Optimizing layout interconnections without increasing area.  
- Ensuring correct control logic for direction.  

Conclusions:  
The 8-bit Rotator circuit was successfully designed and verified. The circuit accurately rotated bits in both directions with negligible delay and power consumption. This experiment demonstrated the importance of bit-level manipulations in digital system design and their efficient VLSI implementation.
