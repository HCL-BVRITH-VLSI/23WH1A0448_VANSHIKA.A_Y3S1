DESIGN REPORT

PROBLEM STATEMENT  
To design and implement a Gray Coder circuit in VLSI that converts a binary input sequence into its corresponding Gray code output. Gray code ensures that only one bit changes between successive numbers, reducing errors in digital systems.  

USE CASE  
- Used in error minimization for counters and digital communication.  
- Helpful in minimizing glitches during binary-to-analog conversion (DACs).  
- Commonly used in position encoders and rotating machinery for error-free detection.  
- Applied in asynchronous communication systems.  

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
1. Input: An n-bit binary sequence.  
2. Output: Corresponding n-bit Gray code sequence.  
3. Conversion logic must ensure only one bit changes between consecutive values.  
4. Must be realizable using CMOS logic gates.  
5. Should work for variable bit-width inputs (e.g., 3-bit, 4-bit).  

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS  
- Limited by available XOR and logic gate cells.  
- Propagation delay should be minimized to support high-speed operation.  
- Power and area should remain within acceptable limits.  
- Proper testing required to ensure no more than one bit changes between consecutive outputs.  

DESIGN METHODOLOGY & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  
1. Conversion Logic  
   - Most Significant Bit (MSB) of Gray code = MSB of binary input.  
   - Each subsequent Gray bit = XOR of current binary bit and the previous binary bit.  

   Example for 4-bit binary input (B3 B2 B1 B0):  
   - G3 = B3  
   - G2 = B3 XOR B2  
   - G1 = B2 XOR B1  
   - G0 = B1 XOR B0  

2. Implementation Steps  
   - XOR gates used for conversion logic.  
   - Designed schematic using standard CMOS gates in CAD tools.  
   - Functional simulation for different binary inputs.  
   - Layout designed and verified using CMOS design rules.  

FUNCTIONAL SIMULATION METHODOLOGY & TEST CASES  
- Input stimulus: Binary numbers applied sequentially (0000 → 1111).  
- Test Cases:  
  - TC1: Binary 0000 → Gray 0000.  
  - TC2: Binary 0001 → Gray 0001.  
  - TC3: Binary 0010 → Gray 0011.  
  - TC4: Binary 0011 → Gray 0010.  
  - TC5: Full sequence verified for single-bit changes between consecutive outputs.  
- Simulation Tool: SPICE/Cadence for waveform verification.  

RESULTS & ANALYSIS  
- Gray code outputs matched the expected truth table.  
- Verified that only one bit changed at each step.  
- Delay per XOR gate was minimal and within timing requirements.  
- Layout verification passed DRC and LVS checks.  

CHALLENGES & CONCLUSIONS  
Challenges:  
- Ensuring correct XOR logic mapping for higher-bit codes.  
- Minimizing delay when chaining multiple XOR gates.  
- Avoiding glitches when inputs switch rapidly.  

Conclusions:  
The Gray Coder circuit was successfully designed and implemented. Simulation confirmed correct binary-to-Gray code conversion with single-bit transitions. This experiment demonstrated the importance of Gray coding in minimizing errors and improving reliability in digital and communication systems.
