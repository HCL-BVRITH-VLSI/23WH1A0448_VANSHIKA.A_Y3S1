DESIGN REPORT:

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To design and implement a Pulse Tracer circuit in VLSI that generates, propagates, and visually verifies the timing of a digital pulse through logic gates and interconnects. The aim is to analyze the delay, shape, and response of the pulse in a digital system.

USE CASE:
Verification of pulse propagation in digital systems.
Studying timing delays and glitches in combinational/sequential circuits.
Useful in clock distribution networks and test pattern verification in VLSI chips.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
Ability to generate a clean pulse from a digital input.
Propagation through different gate stages (inverter/buffer chains).
Visual trace/observation of pulse waveform using simulation tools.
Compatibility with standard CMOS technology libraries.

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS:
Technology node: Limited by standard cell library (e.g., 180nm/90nm CMOS).
Power consumption must remain low.
Pulse width must be sufficient to propagate through chosen number of stages without distortion.
Delay and skew should be measurable within simulation limits.

DESIGN METHODOLOGY & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
Pulse Generator: Implemented using a NAND gate + inverter combination or using a monostable configuration.
Tracer Network: Chain of inverters/buffers to propagate the pulse, allowing observation of delay at each stage.
Schematic Design: Created in VLSI CAD tool (Cadence/DSCH/Microwind).
Layout Design: Standard CMOS layout rules applied (λ-based design rules).
Netlist Generation: Extracted from schematic for functional simulation.

FUNCTIONAL SIMULATION METHODOLOGY & TEST CASES:
Input stimulus: Short digital pulse applied at input.
Test Cases:
TC1: Single short pulse at input → trace through inverter chain.
TC2: Varying pulse width → check minimum width required for propagation.
TC3: High-frequency pulse stream → analyze distortion and delay accumulation.
Simulation Tool: SPICE/Cadence simulator for transient analysis.

RESULTS & ANALYSIS:
Pulse successfully generated and propagated through inverter chain.
Measured propagation delay per stage increased linearly with gate count.
Narrow pulses below a threshold failed to propagate (pulse swallowing).
Power analysis showed low dynamic consumption per stage.
Layout verification passed DRC and LVS checks.

CHALLENGES & CONCLUSIONS:
Challenges:
Maintaining pulse width across multiple stages (avoiding shrinking pulses).
Ensuring layout met DRC rules without increasing parasitic capacitance.
Conclusions:
the Pulse Tracer effectively demonstrated pulse generation and propagation in CMOS VLSI.
The experiment highlighted the importance of pulse width, delay analysis, and layout constraints in real VLSI design.
